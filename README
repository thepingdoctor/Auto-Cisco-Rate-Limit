Rate Limit Changer for Cisco Switches

This Python script connects to a Cisco switch and periodically changes the rate limit on a specific policy map. It cycles through a predefined list of rate limits every 15 minutes, allowing for dynamic bandwidth management on your network.

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.6 or higher
	•	Cisco switch with SSH access and the ability to modify configurations
	•	Netmiko library installed (netmiko handles SSH connections to network devices)

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/thepingdoctor/Auto-Cisco-Rate-Limit.git


	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd Auto-Cisco-Rate-Limit


	3.	Install the required Python packages:

pip install netmiko

Alternatively, if a requirements.txt file is provided:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Configuration

Environment Variables

Before running the script, set the following environment variables with your switch’s connection details:
	•	SWITCH_IP - The IP address of the Cisco switch
	•	SWITCH_USERNAME - SSH username for the switch
	•	SWITCH_PASSWORD - SSH password for the switch
	•	SWITCH_ENABLE_PASSWORD - Password to enter enable mode on the switch

Setting Environment Variables

On Unix/Linux/MacOS:

export SWITCH_IP=192.168.1.1
export SWITCH_USERNAME=admin
export SWITCH_PASSWORD=yourpassword
export SWITCH_ENABLE_PASSWORD=enablepassword

On Windows Command Prompt:

set SWITCH_IP=192.168.1.1
set SWITCH_USERNAME=admin
set SWITCH_PASSWORD=yourpassword
set SWITCH_ENABLE_PASSWORD=enablepassword

On Windows PowerShell:

$env:SWITCH_IP="192.168.1.1"
$env:SWITCH_USERNAME="admin"
$env:SWITCH_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
$env:SWITCH_ENABLE_PASSWORD="enablepassword"

Adjusting the Rate Limits

The script uses a list of predefined rate limits (in bits per second) that it cycles through:

rate_limits = [
    2944000,    # 2.944 Mbps
    14400000,   # 14.4 Mbps
    9312000,    # 9.312 Mbps
    22400000,   # 22.4 Mbps
    7424000,    # 7.424 Mbps
    17344000,   # 17.344 Mbps
    6944000,    # 6.944 Mbps
    27456000,   # 27.456 Mbps
    9952000,    # 9.952 Mbps
    15360000,   # 15.36 Mbps
    34304000,   # 34.304 Mbps
    18336000    # 18.336 Mbps
]

You can modify this list in the script to include the rate limits suitable for your network environment.

Customizing Configuration Commands

The script sends specific configuration commands to the switch:

config_commands = [
    'policy-map tkm-soft',
    'class limit50',
    'no police',
    f'police cir {rate_limit}',
    '  conform-action transmit',
    '  exceed-action drop',
    'end',
    'write memory'
]

	•	Policy Map (policy-map tkm-soft): Ensure this matches the policy map configured on your switch.
	•	Class Map (class limit50): Ensure this matches the class map within your policy.

If your switch uses different policy or class names, update these commands accordingly.

Usage

Run the script with Python:

python rate_limit_changer.py

Functionality:
	•	Environment Variable Check: The script first checks that all required environment variables are set.
	•	Main Loop: It enters a loop where it:
	•	Retrieves the next rate limit from the list.
	•	Connects to the switch via SSH.
	•	Enters enable mode.
	•	Applies the new rate limit to the specified policy map and class.
	•	Saves the configuration.
	•	Waits for 15 minutes before applying the next rate limit.

Note: The script runs indefinitely until manually stopped.

Logging

The script logs its activities to rate_limit_changes.log in the same directory. Logging includes:
	•	Timestamps
	•	Information about rate limit changes
	•	Errors encountered during execution

Sample Log Entry

2023-10-01 12:00:00 INFO: Rate limit changed to 2944000 bps
2023-10-01 12:15:00 INFO: Rate limit changed to 14400000 bps
2023-10-01 12:30:00 ERROR: An error occurred: Connection timed out

Rate Limits

The rate limits are adjusted to standard telecommunication rates, aligning with common bandwidth increments. These adjustments ensure compatibility and optimal performance in network environments.

Understanding the Rate Limits:
	•	2944000 bps: Adjusted from 2,938,033 bps to 2,944,000 bps (2.944 Mbps)
	•	14400000 bps: Adjusted from 14,389,400 bps to 14,400,000 bps (14.4 Mbps)
	•	9312000 bps: Adjusted from 9,313,231 bps to 9,312,000 bps (9.312 Mbps)
	•	22400000 bps: Adjusted from 22,424,200 bps to 22,400,000 bps (22.4 Mbps)
	•	7424000 bps: Adjusted from 7,423,800 bps to 7,424,000 bps (7.424 Mbps)
	•	17344000 bps: Adjusted from 17,332,300 bps to 17,344,000 bps (17.344 Mbps)
	•	6944000 bps: Adjusted from 6,938,033 bps to 6,944,000 bps (6.944 Mbps)
	•	27456000 bps: Adjusted from 27,442,900 bps to 27,456,000 bps (27.456 Mbps)
	•	9952000 bps: Adjusted from 9,938,033 bps to 9,952,000 bps (9.952 Mbps)
	•	15360000 bps: Adjusted from 15,324,300 bps to 15,360,000 bps (15.36 Mbps)
	•	34304000 bps: Adjusted from 34,313,410 bps to 34,304,000 bps (34.304 Mbps)
	•	18336000 bps: Adjusted from 18,324,300 bps to 18,336,000 bps (18.336 Mbps)

Feel free to modify the rate_limits list to match your specific bandwidth requirements.

Troubleshooting

	•	Missing Environment Variables:
If you receive an error about missing environment variables, double-check that all required variables are set and correctly spelled.
	•	Connection Issues:
	•	Ensure the switch’s IP address is correct and reachable.
	•	Verify that SSH is enabled on the switch.
	•	Confirm that the provided username and password have the necessary permissions.
	•	Authentication Failures:
If the script cannot enter enable mode, make sure the SWITCH_ENABLE_PASSWORD is correct and that the user has enable privileges.
	•	Command Errors:
If the switch returns an error for any configuration command, check that the policy map and class names match those on your switch.
	•	Script Exceptions:
Any exceptions will be logged in rate_limit_changes.log. Review this file for detailed error messages.
